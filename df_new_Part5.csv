city,country,Description
Antalya,Turkey,"Once seen simply as the gateway to the Turkish Riviera, Antalya today is very much a destination in its own right. Situated right on the Gulf of Antalya (Antalya Kֳ¶rfezi), the largest city on Turkey's western Mediterranean coastline is both classically beautiful and stylishly modern. At its core is the wonderfully preserved old-city district of Kaleiֳ§i (literally 'within the castle'), which offers atmospheric accommodation in the finely restored Ottoman houses on its winding lanes. The old city wraps around a splendid Roman-era harbour with clifftop views of hazy-blue mountain silhouettes that are worth raising a toast to. Just outside of the central city are two beaches and one of Turkey's finest museums."
Athens,Greece,"With equal measures of grunge and grace, Athens is a heady mix of ancient history and contemporary cool."
Ayia-napa,Cyprus,"Endless blue-sky days and a coastline riddled with sandy pockets helped transform this village into the Mediterranean's summer clubbing capital in the 1990s. Hundreds of clubs and bars set up shop to cater for hedonist-seeking crowds flocking here between June and August and, a couple of decades on, for young Europeans from London to Moscow, Napa (as many visitors refer to it) is still where the party is at its hardest."
Bangkok,Thailand,"Same same, but different. This Thailish T-shirt philosophy sums up Bangkok, a city where the familiar and the exotic collide like the flavours on a plate of pֳ t tai."
Barcelona,Spain,"Barcelona is an enchanting seaside city with boundless culture, fabled architecture and a world-class drinking and dining scene."
Basel,Switzerland,"Historically, Basel's position astride the mighty Rhine has contributed to its growth as a key trade and transport hub. Today, it's a global centre for the pharmaceutical industry ג€“ titans Roche and Novartis are both headquartered here. But that's of little interest to the many thousands of art and architecture lovers who visit each year for the world-famous ART Basel festival and the city's wealth of galleries, museums and iconic buildings."
Batumi,Georgia,"With a backdrop of mist-wrapped hills and soaring snow-capped peaks, Georgiaג€™s second city is a charismatic place with a charming Old Town and a fantastic subtropical climate. Fronted by the calm waters of the Black Sea, Georgia's main summer resort boasts a long beach and a vast and beautifully maintained corniche."
Beijing,China,"From ancient walled capital to showpiece megacity in barely a century, Beijing (Bִ›ijִ«ng, ו—ה÷¬), spins a breathless yarn of triumph, tragedy, endurance and innovation."
Berlin,Germany,"Berlin's combo of glamour and grit is bound to mesmerise all those keen to explore its vibrant culture, cutting-edge architecture, fabulous food, intense parties and tangible history."
Boston,United States,"Boston's history recalls revolution and transformation, and today the city is still among the countryג€™s most forward-thinking and barrier-breaking cities."
Bratislava,Slovakia,"Slovakia's capital since the country's independence in 1993, Bratislava is a mosaic of illustrious history: a medieval and Gothic old town, baroque palaces commissioned by Hungarian nobles, and the crowning castle, rebuilt to Renaissance finery. Slicing through the city are stark-angled, communist-era blocks and a futurist bridge."
Brussels,Belgium,"Historic yet hip, bureaucratic yet bizarre, self-confident yet unshowy, Brussels is multicultural to its roots."
Bucharest,Romania,"Romaniaג€™s capital sometimes gets a bad rap, but in fact it's dynamic, energetic and lots of fun. Many travellers give the city just a night or two before heading off to Transylvania, but thatג€™s not enough time. Allow at least a few days to take in the very good museums, stroll the parks and hang out at trendy cafes and drinking gardens. While much of the centre is modern and the buildings are in various stages of disrepair, you'll find splendid 17th- and 18th-century Orthodox churches and graceful belle ֳ©poque villas tucked away in quiet corners. Communism changed the face of the city forever, and nowhere is this more evident than at the gargantuan Palace of Parliament, the grandest (and arguably crassest) tribute to dictatorial megalomania youג€™ll ever see."
Budapest,Hungary,Budapest has something for everyone ג€“ from dramatic history and flamboyant architecture to healing thermal waters and a nightlife that is unrivalled in Eastern and Central Europe.
Burgas,Bulgaria,"For most visitors, the port city of Burgas (sometimes written as ג€˜Bourgasג€™) is no more than a transit point for the more appealing resorts and historic towns further up and down the coast. If you do decide to stop over, you'll find a lively, well-kept city with a neat, pedestrianised centre, a long, uncrowded beach, a gorgeous seafront park, and some interesting museums. A clutch of reasonably priced hotels, as well as some of the best restaurants in this part of the country, makes it a practical base for exploring the southern coast, too."
Cancun,Mexico,"Cancun is a tale of two cities, with the Zona Hotelera offering majestic Caribbean beaches and Maya culture and Cancֳ÷n Centro providing the local flavor."
Catania,Italy,"For all the noise, chaos and scruffiness that hit the visitor at first glance, Catania has a strong magnetic pull. This is Sicily at its most youthful, a city packed with cool and gritty bars, abundant energy and an earthy spirit in sharp contrast to Palermoג€™s aristocratic airs."
Chiang-mai,Thailand,"The former seat of the Lanna kingdom is a blissfully calm and laid-back place to relax and recharge your batteries. Participate in a vast array of activities, or just stroll around the backstreets, and discover a city that is still firmly Thai in its atmosphere and attitude."
Cologne,Germany,"Cologne (Kֳ¶ln) offers a mother lode of attractions, led by its famous cathedral whose filigree twin spires dominate the skyline. The cityג€™s museum landscape is especially strong when it comes to art but also has something in store for fans of chocolate, sports and even Roman history. Cologne's people are known for their liberalism and joie de vivre; itג€™s easy to have a good time with them in the beer halls of the Altstadt or during Carnival."
Corfu,Greece,"From the writings of Gerald and Lawrence Durrell to the place where the shipwrecked Odysseus was soothed and sent on his way home, Corfu has been portrayed as an idyll for centuries. Today this reputation has led to parts of the island being defiled by mass tourism, but despite this, the Corfu of literature does still exist. All you need to do is sail around the corner, walk over the next headland or potter about the rugged interior and a place of bountiful produce, cypress-studded hills, vertiginous villages, and sandy coves lapped by cobalt-blue waters awaits."
Costa-Brava,Spain,"Stretching north from Barcelona to the Spanishג€“French border, the Costa Brava ('rugged coast') is undoubtedly the most beautiful of Spain's three main holiday coasts. Though there's plenty of tourism development, this wonderfully scenic region of Catalonia also unveils unspoiled coves, spectacular seascapes, wind-battered headlands, coast-hugging hiking paths, charming seaside towns with outstanding restaurants, and some of Spain's finest diving around the protected Illes Medes."
Crete,Greece,"Crete is a tapestry of splendid beaches, ancient treasures and landscapes, weaving in vibrant cities and dreamy villages, where locals share their traditions, wonderful cuisine and generous spirit."
Krakֳ¯ֲ¿,Poland,"Poland's former royal capital effortlessly fuses medieval pomp and pageantry with modern-day, student-fuelled fun into a harmonious whole."
Delhi,India,"Steeped in history yet overflowing with modern life, colorful, cacophonous Delhi pulsates with the relentless rhythms of humanity like few other cities on Earth."
Dresden,Germany,"There are few city silhouettes more striking than Dresdenג€™s. The classic view from the Elbeג€™s northern bank takes in spires, towers and domes belonging to palaces, churches and stately buildings, and indeed it's hard to believe that the city was all but wiped off the map by Allied bombings in 1945."
Dublin,Ireland,"A small capital with a huge reputation, Dublin has a mix of heritage and hedonism that will not disappoint. All you have to do is show up."
Dubrovnik,Croatia,"Regardless of whether you are visiting Dubrovnik for the first time or the hundredth, the sense of awe never fails to descend when you set eyes on the beauty of the old town. Indeed itג€™s hard to imagine anyone becoming jaded by the cityג€™s limestone streets, baroque buildings and the endless shimmer of the Adriatic, or failing to be inspired by a walk along the ancient city walls that protected the capital of a sophisticated republic for centuries."
Dusseldorf,Germany,"Dֳ¼sseldorf impresses with boundary-pushing architecture, zinging nightlife and an art scene to rival many higher-profile cities. Itג€™s a posh and modern city that seems all buttoned-up business at first glance: banking, advertising, fashion and telecommunications are among the fields that have made North Rhineג€“Westphalia's capital one of Germanyג€™s wealthiest cities. Yet all it takes is a few hours of bar-hopping around the Altstadt (the historical quarter along the Rhine) to realise that locals have no problem letting their hair down once they shed those Armani jackets."
Florence,Italy,"Cradle of the Renaissance, romantic, enchanting and utterly irresistible, Florence (Firenze) is a place to feast on world-class art and gourmet Tuscan cuisine."
Frankfurt,Germany,"In this enchanting corner of Germany, the finer things in life take pride of place: good food, great wine, glorious walking and cycling, and exceptional art everywhere, from magnificent museums to quirky street sculptures."
Geneva,Switzerland,"Like the swans that frolic on its eponymous Alpine lake (Europe's largest), Geneva (Genֳ¨ve) is a rare bird. Constantly perceived as the Swiss capital (it isn't), Switzerland's second-largest city is slick and cosmopolitan, and its people chatter in almost every language among streets paved by gold."
Guangzhou,China,"Guַngzhֵu (ו¹¿ו·), once better known internationally as Canton, has been China's busiest trading centre for centuries. Despite breakneck redevelopment up to and after the 2010 Asian Games, much of the metropolis still hums along at a pleasantly sedate pace, where narrow, leafy streets conceal temples and mosques, pockets of colonial-era heritage, traditional dim-sum eateries, distinctive qֳ­lֳ³u shophouses and Lַngnֳ¡n architecture. Equally, you can embrace modernity via the 21st-century architectural landmarks of the showpiece Zhֵ«jiִng New Town, such as the late Zaha Hadid's Opera House and the slim-waisted Canton Tower, rising up over the Pearl River, which cuts a lazy swathe through the city."
Hamburg,Germany,"When all's said and done, Hamburg's appeal can be narrowed down to one simple calling card: Welcome to one of the coolest cities on earth."
Innsbruck,Austria,"Tyrolג€™s capital is a sight to behold. The jagged rock spires of the Nordkette range are so close that within minutes itג€™s possible to travel from the city's heart to more than 2000m above sea level and alpine pastures where cowbells chime. Summer and winter activities abound, and itג€™s understandable why some visitors only take a peek at Innsbruck proper before heading for the hills. But to do so is a shame, for Innsbruck is in many ways Austria in microcosm: its late-medieval Altstadt is picture-book stuff, presided over by a grand Habsburg palace and baroque cathedral, while its Olympic ski jump with big mountain views makes a spectacular leap between the urban and the outdoors."
Istanbul,Turkey,This magical meeting place of East and West has more top-drawer attractions than it has minarets (and that's a lot).
Kos,Greece,"Fringed by the finest beaches in the Dodecanese, dwarfed beneath mighty crags, and blessed with lush valleys, Kos is an island of endless treasures. Visitors soon become blasֳ© at sidestepping the millennia-old Corinthian columns that poke through the rampant wildflowers ג€“ even in Kos Town, the lively capital, ancient Greek ruins are scattered everywhere you turn, and a mighty medieval castle still watches over the harbour."
Ko-samui,Thailand,"Whether you're sun-seeking, dozing in a hammock, feasting on world-class cuisine, beach partying or discovering wellness in an exclusive spa, Ko Samui has it covered."
Kyiv ukrain,Ukraine,"In the beginning there was Kyiv. Long before Ukraine and Russia existed, the city's inhabitants were already striding up and down the green hills, idling hot afternoons away on the Dnipro River and promenading along Khreshchatyk ג€“ then a stream, now the main avenue. From here, East Slavic civilisation spread all the way to Alaska."
LarnaKa,Cyprus,"Larnaka revolves around its seaside position. The coastal promenade ג€“ known universally as the Finikoudes ג€“ is where locals and visitors alike come for a morning coffee or an evening beer, to flop out on the beach during the day and to stroll at sunset. Itג€™s the hub of the scene, with restaurants, cafes and bars galore, and during summer it fully revs up for the annual flood of holidaymakers."
Las-Vegas,United States,"An oasis of indulgence in the desert, Vegas' seduction is hypnotic. The Strip shimmers with promise; like all mirages, though, reality doesn't reflect the veneer."
Limassol,Cyprus,"Still known to many as Limassol, Lemesos is one of Cyprusג€™ most underrated cities. Although fringed on its eastern edge by a glut of bland-looking developments, the core is full of character. Wrapped around a castle, the historic centre radiates out in a web of lanes where old, shuttered houses and modern boutiques lie cheek by jowl. Itג€™s an area buzzing with cafes, bars and restaurants that are as popular with locals as with visitors."
Lisbon,Portugal,"Seven cinematic hillsides overlooking the Rio Tejo cradle Lisbon's postcard-perfect panorama of cobbled alleyways, ancient ruins and white-domed cathedrals ג€“ a captivating scene crafted over centuries."
Ljubljana,Slovenia,"Slovenia's capital and largest city is one of Europe's greenest and most liveable capitals; it was the European Commission's Green Capital of Europe in 2016. Car traffic is restricted in the centre, leaving the leafy banks of the emerald-green Ljubljanica River, which flows through the city's heart, free for pedestrians and cyclists. In summer, cafes set up terrace seating along the river; it almost feels like a nightly street party."
Los Angeles,United States,"Ruggedly good looking, deeply creative, with a sunny disposition to bootג€¦if LA were on Tinder, the app would crash."
Madrid,Spain,Madrid is a beguiling place with an energy that carries one simple message: this city really knows how to live.
Manila,Philippines,"Manila hasֲ outstanding sightseeing it's true, but visitors who put in the effort will discover its creative soul ג€“ from edgy galleries to a lively indie music scene. Combine this with a penchant for speakeasy bars, artisan markets and single-origin coffees, and it's clear to see that Manila is not only one of Asia's most underrated cities, but one of its coolest."
Marseille,France,"Grit and grandeur coexist seamlessly in Marseille, an exuberantly multicultural port city with a pedigree stretching back to classical Greece and a fair claim to the mantle of France's second city. Once seen as somewhat dirty and dangerous, and lacking the glamour of Cannes or St-Tropez, this black sheep of the Provenֳ§al coastline has blossomed in cultural confidence since its 2013 stint as the European Capital of Culture. The addition of a brace of swanky new museums is just the outward sign of an optimism and self-belief that's almost palpable."
Mexico-City,Mexico,"Mexico City is, and has always been, the sun in the Mexican solar system. Though much-maligned in the past, these days the city is cleaning up its act. Revamped public spaces are springing back to life, the culinary scene is exploding and a cultural renaissance is flourishing. On top of all that, by largely managing to distance itself from the drug war, the nationג€™s capital remains a safe haven of sorts. Far from shaking off visitors, the earthquakes of 2017 revealed a young society who attracted admiration through their solidarity."
Miami,United States,"Beautiful beaches and art deco delights are just some of Miamiג€™s many charms ג€“ there's also the blazing nightlife, tropical gardens, lively arts scene and sizzling cuisine."
Milan,Italy,"Milan is Italyג€™s city of the future, a fast-paced metropolis where money talks, creativity is big business and looking good is an art form."
Moscow,Russia,"During any season, at any hour of the day, Moscow thrills visitors with its artistry, history and majesty."
mumbai-bombay,India,"Mumbai, formerly Bombay, is big. Itג€™s full of dreamers and hard-labourers, starlets and gangsters, stray dogs and exotic birds, artists and servants, fisherfolk and crorepatis (millionaires), and lots and lots of people. It has Indiaג€™s most prolific film industry, some of Asiaג€™s biggest slums (as well as the worldג€™s most expensive home) and the largest tropical forest in an urban zone. Mumbai is Indiaג€™s financial powerhouse, fashion epicentre and a pulse point of religious tension."
Munich,Germany,"Tall tankards and high-tech cars, edgy art and Lederhosen ג€“ Munich is a city where traditional and modern sit side by side like few places on earth."
Mykonos,Greece,"Mykonos is the great glamour island of Greece and flaunts its sizzling St-Tropez-meets-Ibiza style and party-hard reputation. The high-season mix of hedonistic holidaymakers, cruise-ship crowds, buff gay men and posturing fashionistas throngs Mykonos Town (aka Hora), a gorgeous whitewashed Cycladic maze, delighting in its cubist charms and its chichi cafe-bar-boutique scene."
Naples Italy,Italy,"Naples is raw, high-octane energy, a place of soul-stirring art and panoramas, spontaneous conversations and unexpected, inimitable elegance. Welcome to Italy's most unlikely masterpiece."
Nice,France,"With its mix of real-city grit, old-world opulence, year-round sunshine, vibrant street life and stunning seaside location, no place in France compares with Nice."
Odesa,Ukraine,"Odesa is a city straight from literature ג€“ an energetic, decadent boom town. Its famous Potemkin Steps sweep down to the Black Sea and Ukraine's biggest commercial port. Behind them, a cosmopolitan cast of characters makes merry among neoclassical pastel buildings lining a geometric grid of leafy streets."
Paris,France,"Paris' monument-lined boulevards, museums, classical bistros and boutiques are enhanced by a new wave of multimedia galleries, creative wine bars, design shops and tech start-ups."
Phuket,Thailand,"Jade-hued waves concealing rainbows of fish wash white-gold beaches wrapped in Phuketian heritage: Phuket (א¸ א¸¹א¹€א¸א¹‡א¸•), Thailand's dazzling largest island, is so diverse you may never want to leave."
Rhodes,Greece,"By far the largest and historically the most important of the Dodecanese islands, Rhodes (ro-dos) abounds in beaches, wooded valleys and ancient history. Whether youג€™re here on a culture-vulture journey through past civilisations, or simply for some laidback beach time, buzzing nightlife, or diving in crystal-clear waters, itג€™s all here. The atmospheric Old Town of Rhodes is a maze of cobbled streets that will spirit you back to the days of the Byzantine Empire and beyond. Further south, in the picture-perfect town of Lindos, capped by an ancient Acropolis, sugar-cube houses spill down to a turquoise bay. While both Lindos and Rhodes Old Town get very crowded in summer, Rhodes is large enough to allow plenty of room to breathe that pure Aegean air."
Rome,Italy,"A heady mix of haunting ruins, awe-inspiring art and vibrant street life, Italyג€™s hot-blooded capital is one of the worldג€™s most romantic and charismatic cities."
Salzburg,Austria,"The joke 'If it's baroque, don't fix it' is a perfect maxim for Salzburg: the story-book Altstadt (old town) burrowed below steep hills looks much as it did when Mozart lived here 250 years ago. Beside the fast-flowing Salzach River, your gaze is raised inch by inch to graceful domes and spires, the formidable clifftop fortress and the mountains beyond. It's a backdrop that did the lordly prince-archbishops and Maria proud."
San-Francisco,United States,"Other cities may surprise you, but in San Francisco you will surprise yourself."
Shanghai,China,"Shanghai: few cities in the world evoke so much history, excess, glamour, mystique and exotic promise in name alone."
Sofia,Bulgaria,"Bulgaria's pleasingly laid-back capital is often overlooked by visitors heading to the coast or the ski resorts, but they're missing something special. Sofia is no grand metropolis, but it's a modern, youthful city, with a scattering of onion-domed churches, Ottoman mosques and stubborn Red Army monuments that lend an eclectic, exotic feel. Excavation work carried out during construction of the metro unveiled a treasure trove of Roman ruins from nearly 2000 years ago, when the city was called 'Serdica'. Away from the buildings and boulevards, vast parks and manicured gardens offer a welcome respite, and the ski slopes and hiking trails of mighty Mt Vitosha are just a short bus ride from the centre. Home to many of Bulgaria's finest museums, galleries, restaurants and clubs, Sofia may persuade you to stick around and explore further."
St-Petersburg Russia,Russia,"The sheer grandeur and history of Russia's imperial capital never fail to amaze, but this is also a city with a revolutionary spirit."
Stuttgart,Germany,"Ask many Germans their opinion of Stuttgarters and they'll have plenty of things to say: they are road hogs, speeding along the autobahn; they are sharp-dressed executives with a Swabian drawl; they are tight-fisted homebodies who slave away to schaffe, schaffe, Hֳ₪usle baue (work, work, build a house)."
Taipei,Taiwan,"Taipei is a friendly city whose allure lies in its blend of Chinese culture with a curious fusion of Japanese, Southeast Asian and American influences."
Tbilisi,Georgia,"With its dramatic valley setting, picturesque Old Town, eclectic architecture and superb eating and drinking opportunities, Tbilisi is the vibrant, beating heart of Georgia and home to more than one in three of its citizens. Add to that the pull of the city's hipster culture, its techno scene and general air of cool, and Tbilisi is confidently sealing its reputation as the South Caucasus' most cosmopolitan city."
Thessaloniki,Greece,"Thessaloniki is easy to fall in love with ג€“ it has beauty, chaos, history and culture, a remarkable cuisine and wonderful, vast sea views. This is Greeceג€™s second city, which, like the rest of the country, has suffered the hit of the economic crisis, but the streets remain full of life and vibrancy."
Toronto,Canada,"Bright and bustling, Toronto is a cosmopolitan city whose residents have roots across the globe. Art, food, beaches, nightlife ג€“ in Toronto, youג€™ve got it all."
Venice,Italy,Imagine the audacity of building a city of marble palaces on a lagoon ג€“ and that was only the start.
Vienna,Austria,Baroque streetscapes and imperial palaces set the stage for Vienna's artistic and musical masterpieces alongside its coffee-house culture and vibrant epicurean and design scenes.
Warsaw,Poland,"A phoenix arisen from the ashes, Poland's capital impresses with its resilience, respect for history, contemporary style and sheer joie de vivre."
Zakynthos,Greece,"Zakynthos, also known by its Italian name Zante, is an island of two stories. The southern and southeastern shorelines are dominated by heavy ג€“ and often low-quality ג€“ package tourism, although even here there are some attractive lower-key bases hiding just out of sight of the larger, run-of-the-mill resorts; examples include Keri and Limni Keriou in the remoter southwest. Once you leave the south behind, however, and set off to explore the rest of the island, you'll discover a different place altogether. It's one where plenty of forested wilderness and traditional rural villages remain, but itג€™s the spectacular scenery of the rugged west coast, where mighty limestone cliffs plummet down to unreal turquoise waters, thatג€™s the true highlight."
Zurich,Switzerland,"Culturally vibrant, efficiently run and attractively set at the meeting of river and lake, Zֳ¼rich is regularly recognised as one of the world's most liveable cities. Long known as a savvy, hard-working financial centre, Switzerland's largest and wealthiest metropolis has also emerged in the 21st century as one of Central Europe's hippest destinations, with an artsy, post-industrial edge that is epitomised in its exuberant summer Street Parade."
